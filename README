The Wall explosion is an CSS3 3D experiment for Mozilla Dev Derby

Each brick is 3D, and the whole wall is also 3D.
Push the detonator, and watch the explosion!

* It works in Firefox and WebKit, but in Firefox(Nightly 14), it seems to be too slow in my pc *
* Let's test, and make some code improvements *
